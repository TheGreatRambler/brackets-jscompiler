# JSCompiler for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)

JSCompiler is a tool for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) that allows you to compress and mangle your JavaScript code into one minified file, powered by [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

## Usage

Simply press the "Compress JavaScript" button on the sidebar, or go to File > Compress JavaScript, and your code will be compressed into a `{filename}.min.js` file.

## Another JavaScript Compresser for Brackets?

I'm aware that this is not the first compress tool for JavaScript in Brackets, but those I've tried, did require previous configuration to the project, or send the compression task to a website, making it poorly optimized and potentially unreliable.

With this in mind, I decided to make my own version, that was simple, fast and reliable for this task, resulting on the extension that is now here.

Special thanks to Steffen Bruchmann and Peter Flynn, who helped me a lot on my first steps with brackets extension development.
